# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project 2 Resources: Class activities week 13 Tuesday and Thursday class activities were main contributors to my part in the challenge. Part one : Create category and subcategory data frames. Split the column 'categories & sub-categories' into two columns. Create cat ids and scat id's. Save a category dataframe and save as a csv - save a subcaegories dataframe and save as a csv. The csv files are saved in the Resources folder in Git Hub.

CSV File 'Campain' reqiures the Goal column to be converted to a number without decimal places.
